# Goblin Hunter ðŸŽ®  
*A prototype 3D dungeon shooter built in Unity.*  

## Description  
Goblin Hunter is a half-finished prototype game where the player explores a custom-built dungeon environment and clears enemies. Small goblins (currently represented by spheres) patrol the dungeon and will chase the player when they come within range, using Unityâ€™s NavMesh system. The player can defend themselves using a pistol or a shotgun, while managing a basic health system.  

## Features  
- Fully custom-made dungeon environment and decorative assets  
- Enemy AI powered by Unityâ€™s NavMesh system, with simple chase behaviour  
- Two player weapons: pistol and shotgun (hand-written shooting mechanics)  
- Player health system with animated feedback  
- Visual effects to enhance the 3D atmosphere  

## Tech Stack  
- **Engine:** Unity 6000.0.30f1  
- **Language:** C#  
- **Tools:** Unity NavMesh, prefab-based player controller, hand-written weapon scripts  

## Gameplay  
- Spawn into the dungeon  
- Explore the environment while avoiding goblins

## Status  
This project is a prototype developed to explore environment design, AI behaviour, and shooting mechanics in Unity. No further development is planned.
